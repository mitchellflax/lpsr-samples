Bonus for PS9:

Modify your Caesar cipher program so that it gracefully handles being given a character that isn't in your alphabet. Use error handling (try/except) to make your program give an error message that explains to the user the problem. If the user has submitted a message containing a character that isn't in your dictionary, you should tell the user, "You've used a character in your message that can't be encoded/decoded. Please try again with only letters A-Z, a-z, and spaces."
